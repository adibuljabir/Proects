# Developer Guide for TA-DA Tour Diary and Transport Bill Generator  


## **Overview**  
This guide explains the internal workings of the program to help developers understand the code and contribute effectively. The program is written in **C** and serves to record transport journeys and calculate expenses for carrying goods.  

## **Code Structure**  

### **1. Input Handling**  
- Users input journey details, including dates, locations, goods, and expenses.  
- Inputs are validated for correct journey types and date formats.  

### **2. File Operations**  
- **Files Used**:  
  - `Tour_Diary.txt`: Logs journey details.  
  - `Transport_Bill.txt`: Logs transport expenses.  
- Files are opened in **append mode** to preserve previous data.  

### **3. Logic Flow**  
- **Do-While Loop**: Used for iterative input.  
- **Menu Selection**: Allows selection of journey type (depart or return).  
- Data is processed and written to respective files.  

### **4. Expense Calculation**  
- Individual and total expenses are recorded for each journey.  
- Expense types include loading, transportation, and unloading.  


## **Code Walkthrough**  

### Explanation of the Program

---

#### **1. Header Files**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
```
- **`stdio.h`**: Provides functions for input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`, `fopen`).
- **`string.h`**: Used for string manipulation (e.g., `fgets`, `strcspn`).

---

#### **2. Main Function**
- Acts as the entry point of the program.
- Manages input/output and writes data to files.

---

#### **3. File Handling**
```c
FILE *Tour_Diary = fopen("Tour_Diary.txt", "a");
FILE *Transport_Bill = fopen("Transport_Bill.txt", "a");
```
- **Opens files** in append mode (`a`), preserving existing content while allowing new data to be added.
- Ensures **data persistence** across multiple program runs.

**Error Handling:**
```c
if (Tour_Diary == NULL || Transport_Bill == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening files.\n");
    return 1;
}
```
- Terminates the program if files fail to open.

---

#### **4. User Input and Journey Type**
```c
int case_;
do {
    printf("Declare Your Journey Type:\n1. Departed with goods\n2. Returned with goods\n");
    scanf("%d", &case_);
} while (case_ != 1 && case_ != 2);
```
- Prompts the user to select a journey type.
- Uses a **loop** to ensure valid input (`1` or `2`).

---

#### **5. Journey and Goods Details**

**Goods Name:**
```c
char goods[100];
printf("Goods name you carried: ");
fgets(goods, sizeof(goods), stdin);
goods[strcspn(goods, "\n")] = 0;
```
- **`fgets`** ensures robust input handling, allowing spaces in names.
- **`strcspn`** removes the trailing newline character.

**Journey Dates, Times, and Locations:**
```c
int day1, month1, year1;
printf("Order Date (DD MM YYYY): ");
scanf("%d %d %d", &day1, &month1, &year1);

char location1[100];
printf("Departed From: ");
fgets(location1, sizeof(location1), stdin);
location1[strcspn(location1, "\n")] = 0;
```
- Collects structured data (e.g., dates, times, locations).
- Separate variables (`day2`, `month2`, `year2`, etc.) store departure and arrival details.

**Distance:**
```c
int distance;
printf("Enter Distance (in km): ");
scanf("%d", &distance);
```
- Records the journey's distance.


#### **6. Expenses and Vehicle Information**

**Transport Vehicle:**
```c
char vehicle[100];
printf("Transport Vehicle: ");
fgets(vehicle, sizeof(vehicle), stdin);
vehicle[strcspn(vehicle, "\n")] = 0;
```

**Expenses:**
```c
float expense1, expense2, expense3;
printf("Enter Expenses in tk.paisa (loading, transportation, unloading): ");
scanf("%f %f %f", &expense1, &expense2, &expense3);
```
- Splits expenses into three categories: **loading**, **transportation**, and **unloading**.


#### **7. Writing to Files**

**Tour Diary:**
```c
fprintf(Tour_Diary, "| %02d-%02d-%04d | Starting On %02d-%02d-%04d at %02d:%02d, ...");
```
- Logs details such as:
  - Departure/arrival times.
  - Locations.
  - Goods carried.
  - Distance.

**Transport Bill:**
```c
fprintf(Transport_Bill, "| %02d-%02d-%04d | Expenditure bill for porter/labor wages for loading ...");
```
- Logs:
  - Expenses itemized by category (loading, transportation, unloading).
  - Total calculated expenses.


#### **8. Restart Mechanism**
```c
printf("\nWant to add more? (1 for Yes, 0 for No): ");
scanf("%d", &restart);
```
- Asks the user if they wish to generate more logs.
- Loops back if the user selects `1`.


#### **9. Exiting the Program**
```c
printf("Program exited. Thank you!\n");
return 0;
```
- Displays an exit message.
- Ends the program when the user opts not to add more entries.


This structured design ensures clarity, user-friendliness, and efficient logging of journey details and expenses.
## **Key Features for Developers**  

### **1. Error Handling**  
- Ensures files are properly opened.  
- Prompts for valid journey type input.  

### **2. File Management**  
- Data is appended to ensure existing logs are preserved.  
- Files are closed after writing to prevent resource leaks.  

### **3. Modular Structure**  
- Inputs are grouped logically (goods, journey, expenses).  
- Output formatting is consistent.  

### **4. User-Friendly Design**  
- Clear prompts guide users.  
- Allows retries for invalid inputs.  


## **Areas for Improvement**  
1. **Input Validation**: Validate date/time correctness & prevent negative distances or expenses.  
2. **Error Messages**: Provide specific feedback for invalid inputs.  
3. **Modularity**: Break large functions into smaller helper functions for better readability.  
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure file paths and newline handling are consistent across OS.  
5. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Introduce dynamic memory allocation for large data sets.  
6. **File Formats**: Add support for CSV or JSON file formats.  
7. **GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface for improved usability.
